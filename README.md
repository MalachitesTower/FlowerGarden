# FlowerGarden
Remaking the game Seed for coding practice: https://www.noio.nl/2007/12/seed/

Currently available: 
- Random Flower generation, can be respawned on button click
- Random stem generation, although too random right now

Long Term Goals
- Flower specific actions, so delete just one flower or grow a new flower from an old one.
- Mix flowers together 
- Change how images are stored so I can change the alpha or have them 'grow' as in Seed original
- Give the user the option of inputting their own flower code, or viewing what is there already.
